* Seperation of concerns
* Easier migrations or tech upgrade

---
### Challenges of Microfrontends 😢

* Communication between microfrontends
* CSS Pollution
* Client side routing

---
### Microfrontend Patterns 🔨

- Server Based
  - Rewrite Config
- Client Based
  - iframe
  - Dynamic Asset Loading
  - Module Federation
---
### Server Based
- Update your server config 🎉
```
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://s3.amazonaws.com/root/index.html;
  }
  location /jobs {
    proxy_pass http://s3.amazonaws.com/jobs/index.html;
  }
```

- Full page reload while switching between microfrontends
- Duplicate dependencies (react, react-dom) downloaded everytime

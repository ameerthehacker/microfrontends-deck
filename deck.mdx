### Microfrontends 🎤
---
### What is Microfrontend 🤷

- Build independent frontend pieces
- May or may not use same view library or framework
- Make them work together as a cohorent single frontend

---
### When do you need Microfrontends 🤷

* Multiple team working on different aspects of a site
* Independent and faster release cycles
* Need for different view library in various aspects of a site

---
### Advantages of Microfrontends ❤️

* Easier developer onboarding
* Seperation of concerns
* Easier migrations or tech upgrade

---
### Challenges of Microfrontends 😢

* Duplicate dependencies
* Maintaining common coding practices
* Communication between microfrontends
* CSS Pollution
* Client side routing

---
### Microfrontend Patterns 🔨

- Server Based
  - Rewrite Config
- Client Based
  - iframe
  - Dynamic Asset Loading
  - Module Federation
---
### Server Based
- Update your server config 🎉
```
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://s3.amazonaws.com/root/index.html;
  }
  location /jobs {
    proxy_pass http://s3.amazonaws.com/jobs/index.html;
  }
```
---
### Pros 😎
- Easiest to start using microfrontends
- No tooling changes required in your frontends
- No CSS Pollution
- Different View libraries/frameworks

### Cons 😢
- Full page reload while switching between microfrontends
- Duplicate dependencies (react, react-dom) downloaded everytime
- No reuse of common components like **Navbar**, **Footer**
---
### Client Based

<img src={clientBased} />

---
### IFrame 🖼️
- Add server config to load from various s3 buckets
- The shell will load pages based on the routes in the iframes

#### Challenges 😢
- No cookie sharing between iframes
- Syncing routes between shell and iframe
---
### Pros 😎
- No CSS Pollution
- Different View libraries/frameworks
- No full page reload
- Reuse of common components like **Navbar**, **Footer** in shell

### Cons 😢
- Not good for SEO
- Duplicate dependencies (react, react-dom) downloaded everytime
---
### Dynamic Asset Loading ⚙️
- Dynamically mount and unmount apps in the shell
---
### Pros 😎
- Good for SEO
- No full page reload
- Reuse of common components like **Navbar**, **Footer** in shell
- Some of the common dependencies like **React** can be kept in shell

### Cons 😢

- CSS Pollution
- Using different View libraries/frameworks is tricky
- Version lock of dependencies across frontends

---
### Module Federation

- Uses webpack module federation
- User build artifacts from a different webpack build
---

### Pros 😎
- Common dependencies with no version lock
- Using different View libraries/framework is less tricky,

### Cons 😢
- CSS Pollution
- Vendor lock to webpack

---
### Thank you 🙏
